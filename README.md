# JuliaSeminar

The goal of this seminar is to give a complete overview to aspects of the Julia language as well as general design patterns and practices which are relevant for scientific programming. That is, ultimately, how to write performant albeit general and transparent code in Julia.

This seminar was offered to the members of the Collaborative Research Center SFB/TR 185 "OSCAR" [and collaborators and friends] with sessions on the 11.03, 18.03, 25.03 and 01.04 of 2021. The advanced topics were not discussed but still might be in the future. The solutions for the exercises are inside the `.jl` files that generate the notebooks.
